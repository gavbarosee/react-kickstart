# Feature Templates

Templates for integrating specific features (state management, etc.) into React applications.

## Purpose

These templates generate the actual component code that demonstrates and integrates feature libraries into the generated React applications.

## Structure

- `redux-counter-template.js` - Redux Toolkit integration with counter example
- `zustand-counter-template.js` - Zustand integration with counter example

## How it works

Feature templates:

- Replace or modify existing App components to include feature integration
- Add working examples to demonstrate the feature library
- Handle different frameworks (Vite, Next.js App Router, Next.js Pages Router)
- Integrate with different styling solutions (Tailwind, styled-components, CSS)

## Features

Each template provides:

- Framework-specific integration patterns
- Working examples with full functionality
- Proper import statements for the chosen feature library
- Styling-aware component generation
- Router-aware component placement (App vs HomePage)

## Future Features

This directory can be expanded to include templates for:

- API client integrations
- Testing setup examples
- Authentication patterns
- Other feature-specific templates
